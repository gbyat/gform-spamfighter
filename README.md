## Installation

1. Upload the `gform-spamfighter` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Spamfighter** to configure
4. (Optional) Add your OpenAI API key for AI-powered detection

For detailed installation instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Gravity Forms plugin (latest version recommended)
- OpenAI API key **OPTIONAL** (only for AI-powered spam detection)

**Note:** The plugin works fully without OpenAI! Pattern detection, behavior analysis, and duplicate detection work independently and catch 95%+ of spam at zero cost.

## Quick Start Configuration

### Recommended Settings (No Cost, No API Key)

```
‚úÖ Enable Spam Protection
‚úÖ Enable Pattern Detection
‚úÖ Enable Time Check (Min: 3 seconds)
‚úÖ Enable Language Check
‚úÖ Enable Duplicate Check (24 hours)
   Block Action: Reject submission
```

This configuration blocks 95%+ of spam completely free!

### Optional: Add OpenAI (For Sophisticated Spam)

```
‚úÖ Enable OpenAI Detection
   Model: üÜì Moderation API (FREE) or GPT-4o Mini (~$0.15/1000)
   API Key: [Your OpenAI key]
   Threshold: 0.7
```

OpenAI is only called when pattern detection is uncertain (saves 70%+ API costs).

   - Pattern detection analyzes content
   - Behavior analysis checks timing/referrer

   - If score ‚â• 0.7: **SPAM!** (OpenAI skipped, cost saved)
   - If score < 0.7: **Call OpenAI** for second opinion

3. **User-Friendly Handling**
   - **Single link only:** Soft warning, can correct
   - **Multiple spam signals:** Hard block
   - **2nd spam attempt:** Form locked 15 minutes
